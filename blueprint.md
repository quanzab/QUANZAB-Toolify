# QUANZAB Toolkit - Project Blueprint

This document outlines the architecture, features, and technical specifications of the QUANZAB Toolkit application.

## 1. Core Philosophy

QUANZAB Toolkit is a comprehensive, all-in-one productivity suite designed to be fast, secure, and intuitive. It leverages modern web technologies and AI to streamline common tasks related to documents, business productivity, and text manipulation. The application prioritizes user experience with a clean, dark-mode-first interface and responsive design.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** React 19 with TypeScript
- **Routing:** React Router v6
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a custom theme configuration.
- **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, custom hooks).
- **Client-Side Libraries:**
  - **PDF Manipulation:** `pdf-lib` (merging, signing), `pdfjs-dist` (rendering, splitting, compressing, conversion).
  - **File Handling:** `react-dropzone`, `file-saver`, `jszip`.
  - **AI Integration:** `@google/genai` for Gemini API access.

## 3. Application Architecture

- **`index.tsx`**: Main entry point, renders the React application.
- **`App.tsx`**: Core component handling routing, layout (Header/Footer), and lazy loading of page components.
- **`components/`**: Contains reusable UI components used across the application (e.g., `ToolCard`, `FileDropzone`, `Header`, `Loader`).
- **`pages/`**: Each tool has its own page component (e.g., `PdfMergePage.tsx`, `TextSummarizerPage.tsx`). This allows for code splitting and lazy loading.
- **`hooks/`**: Houses custom hooks for shared logic, such as `useTheme` for theme toggling and `useTaskManager` for business logic.
- **`data/`**: Stores static data like the list of available tools (`tools.ts`).
- **`types.ts`**: Centralized location for TypeScript type definitions and interfaces.
